# Question 1

```{r}
### Loading in prostate data
data("Prostate") 
dat_prostate <- Prostate
```

## Part A
(a) Fit a regression tree with lpsa as the response and the other variables as predictors. Use cross-validation to determine the optimal tree size. Which tree size corresponds to the lowest cross-validation error? Is this the same as the tree size obtained using the 1 SE rule?

```{r}
set.seed(1)

tree_prost_1 <- rpart(formula = lpsa ~., data = dat_prostate)
rpart.plot(tree_prost_1)

### Finding lowest cp 
cp_table <- printcp(tree_prost_1)
plotcp(tree_prost_1)


```
